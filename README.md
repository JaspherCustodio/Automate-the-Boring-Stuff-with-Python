# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - Project Repository

This repository contains my implementations of various tasks and exercises from the book **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python** by Al Sweigart. Each script is a solution to a real-world problem, showcasing automation techniques and Python programming concepts.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by chapters, with each folder containing relevant scripts and files:

### Chapter 3: Functions
- **`magic8Ball.py`**: A Magic 8 Ball program that provides random answers to yes/no questions.
- **`theCollatzSequence.py`**: Implements the Collatz sequence, taking user input and showing the sequence until it reaches 1.

### Chapter 4: Lists
- **`characterCount.py`**: Counts characters in a given text using dictionaries.
- **`coinFlip.py`**: Simulates a coin flip and records the results.

### Chapter 5: Dictionaries and Structuring Data
- **`fantasyGameInventory.py`**: Simulates a fantasy game's inventory system using dictionaries.
- **`picnicTable.py`**: Formats data in a tabular structure for display.

### Chapter 6: Strings
- **`isPhoneNumber.py`**: Identifies whether a string is a valid phone number.
- **`regexSearch.py`**: Searches for patterns in text using regular expressions.

### Chapter 7: Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions
- **`phoneNumberAndEmailAddressExtractor.py`**: Extracts phone numbers and email addresses from a given text.
- **`regexVersionOfStrip().py`**: Recreates Python's `strip()` method using regular expressions.

### Chapter 8: Reading and Writing Files
- **`madLibs.py`**: Automates creating Mad Libs by replacing placeholders in a text file.
- **`bulletPointAdder.py`**: Adds bullet points to lines of text copied to the clipboard.

### Chapter 9: Organizing Files
- **`backingUpFolderIntoZip.py`**: Creates a ZIP archive of a folder and its contents.
- **`deletingUnneededFiles.py`**: Deletes files larger than a specified size in a directory.

### Chapter 12: Working with Excel Files
- **`census2010.py`**: Script that processes census data from an Excel file.
- **`censuspopdata.xlsx`**: Dataset used by `census2010.py` to calculate and analyze population data.
- **`example.xlsx`**: Sample Excel file used in examples and exercises.
- **`produceSales.xlsx`**: Dataset for tracking produce sales.
- **`readCensusExcel.py`**: Script to read and analyze data from `censuspopdata.xlsx`.
- **`updateProduce.py`**: Script that updates prices in the `produceSales.xlsx` spreadsheet.

### Status
- Work in progress: Additional scripts and explanations will be added as I progress further in the book.
